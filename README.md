# The Prompt Generation

Modern, multi-page static website scaffold for local development and later deployment.

## Folder structure

```text
Prompt Website/
  index.html
  pages/
    prompts.html
  assets/
    css/
      base.css
      home.css
      prompts.css
    js/
      main.js
      prompts.js
```

## Why this color system

The palette uses:

- deep navy backgrounds for reduced eye fatigue and stronger contrast,
- cyan + violet highlights for a modern AI-tech look,
- mint accents for positive actions such as "copy" and "start",
- soft transparency layers for glass-like depth.

This approach keeps readability high while still feeling modern and animated.
